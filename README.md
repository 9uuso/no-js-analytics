#no-js-analytics
##simple analytics middleware for [express](http://expressjs.com/)

no-js-analytics is a basic visitor analytics for people interested in trading the speed of server-side for fewer analytical features.

no-js-analytics works even if visitor does not have javascript enabled, which results in logging all those security paranoids running noscript too. no-js-analytics saves statics of any call to API's and alike, without messing response data. no-js-analytics requires no database, because all visitor statics are held in **object**, ingeniously named as db. This makes no-js-analytics easy to adopt and the basic fundamental of speed is met. On the downside all visitor statics will be lost in case of server crash. Because of this, the object containing the statics is saved every two hours (by default) into logs and no-js-analytics also provides an easy way to express that data in a nice JSON format with the analytics.stats() method. Here is an example output:

```
{
  "Browser": {
    "Firefox": {
      "views": 6
    },
    "Safari": {
      "views": 11
    }
  },
  "Platform": {
    "Microsoft Windows": {
      "views": 9
    },
    "Apple Mac": {
      "views": 3
    },
    "iPhone": {
      "views": 5
    }
  },
  "Type": {
    "desktop": {
      "views": 13
    },
    "mobile": {
      "views": 11
    }
  },
  "Path": {
    "/": {
      "views": 20
    },
    "/analytics": {
      "views": 4
    }
  },
  "Language": {
    "en-US": {
      "views": 24
    }
  },
  "overall": {
    "views": 24
  }
}
```

##Tests
   I made two tests locally on the default express page and below are the results.  
   [google analytics](http://snag.gy/WFO8T.jpg)  
   [no-js-analytics](http://snag.gy/qctlQ.jpg)  
   As you can see, the amount of requests went down by 4 and the overall response time reduced by 150ms - **locally**.

##Installation:   
```$ npm install no-js-analytics```

##Usage:
```javascript
var analytics = require('no-js-analytics');

app.configure(function(){
  ... (start of your express configuration)

  app.use(express.bodyParser());
  // Add analytics below express.bodyParser()
  app.use(analytics);

  ... (rest of your configuration)
});
```

##Methods
###analytics.save()
   Writes the current data of db object into a new .txt file in ./analytics-logs
###analytics.stats()
   Renders the current data of db object in JSON format. For an example, you might want to show the data in /analytics page, which can easily be achieved as below.
```
app.get('/analytics', function(req, res){
  res.send(200, analytics.stats());
});
```
###Defaults
   Top of these methods no-js-analytics automatically saves visitor information into a text file every two hours, declared in milliseconds at lib/middleware.js. There you can also find the default interval of database flush, which is set to happen once in a day.

###To-do
1. Returning and new visitor counters
2. Some nice way to represent the data and more robust data structure (Polychart.js?)
3. More features in general
1004. Spread to additional frameworks and languages
1337 * 10‚Åπ. World domination and bye-bye to formal client-side javascript analytics
